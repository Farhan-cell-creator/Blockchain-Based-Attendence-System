Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will design and implement an advanced multi-layered Blockchain-Based
Attendance Management System (BAMS) using:
 Node.js Backend (mandatory)
 Any frontend (React, Next.js, Vue, HTML/JS, etc.)
 Custom-built blockchain logic (no external blockchain libraries)
Unlike traditional single-chain implementations, this project requires you to create three
hierarchical blockchain layers:
Layer 1 — Department Blockchain
Each department (e.g., School of Computing, School of Software Engineering) has its own
blockchain.
The genesis block is tied only to the department.
Layer 2 — Class Blockchain (Child of Department Chain)
Each class inside a department spawns its own blockchain:
 Its genesis block uses the department’s latest block hash as its prev_hash.
 Meaning: all classes depend on and extend the department chain.
Layer 3 — Student Blockchain (Child of Class Chain)
Each student has their own personal blockchain ledger:
 Its genesis block uses the class chain’s latest block hash as its prev_hash.
 The student’s attendance blocks attach to their personal chain.
 This makes the entire hierarchy:
Department → Class → Student → Attendance blocks
all cryptographically interlinked.
This design builds a 3-dimensional hierarchical blockchain, where altering a department block
invalidates:
 all its child class chains
 all student chains under those classes
 all attendance entries for those students
This simulates real-world cross-linked blockchain structures (similar to sharded chains,
subnetworks, and parent-child DAG chains).

Basic Requirements
The system you are building will manage attendance for a fictional school. The school has two
departments: The School of Computing and The School of Software Engineering. Each department
contains five classes, and each class contains thirty-five students.
While this structure is provided as a default reference, your system must allow administrators to add
or remove departments, create new classes under departments, and add or remove students
dynamically. You may also allow editing or customizing these structures through your interface.
Functional Requirements
Your application must allow full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) management for departments,
classes, and students. Administrators should be able to add new departments, remove existing ones,
view the complete department list, and search for a department by name.
Classes must be managed under their respective departments. The system should let an admin
create a class inside a department, remove one, browse all classes, and locate a specific class
through a search function.
For students, your system must allow adding a new student with attributes such as name, roll
number, department, and assigned class. Deleting or editing a student&#39;s details must be supported
as well. Students should be searchable by name or roll number.
Most importantly, your system must display a student&#39;s personal attendance history in blockchain
form, meaning every attendance entry connected through hashes, nonces, and timestamps.
The attendance module must let the administrator mark whether a student is Present, Absent, or on
Leave. Every attendance record should automatically generate a blockchain transaction containing
the student’s details and attendance status. Administrators must be able to view attendance for the
current day, for any class, for an entire department, and the complete attendance history for any
individual student.
You must implement full CRUD for:
1. Departments
Admins can add, view, search, and update department metadata.
However, no block may be removed. So:
Deleting or Updating a Department
You cannot erase or modify an existing block.
Instead:
 A new block must be added to the Department Blockchain stating:
o status: &quot;deleted&quot; OR
o updated fields (name_updated, meta_updated, etc.)
 Previous blocks remain intact.
 Newer blocks override older ones based on timestamp priority.

2. Classes
Classes belong to a specific department and must inherit blockchain safety as well.
Admins can add, view, update, and search classes.
Class Additions
 Creating a class generates a Class Chain GENESIS block with:
o prev_hash = latest_block_of_parent_department_chain.

Updating or Deleting a Class
Again, no historical block is allowed to change.
Instead:
 A new block is appended containing:
o updated details
o or status: &quot;deleted&quot;.
 Older blocks are never removed.

3. Students
Admins can add, remove, update, and search students.
Student Additions
 Creates a Student Chain GENESIS block with:
o prev_hash = latest_block_of_class_chain.

Student Deletion or Update
No block may be erased or modified. So:
 A new block is added to that student’s chain:
o status: &quot;deleted&quot; or
o updated fields (name, roll no, etc.)
 When reading student data, the system prioritizes the most recent block for interpretation.

B. Attendance System
Mark attendance categories:
 Present
 Absent
 Leave
Each attendance record becomes a block inside the student blockchain, containing:
 Student details
 Department ID
 Class ID
 Timestamp
 Status
 Previous student block hash
 Nonce (PoW)
 Final computed hash

BlockChain Requirement
Your blockchain must resemble a real blockchain system, with each block containing several
essential fields: an index for identifying the block number, a list of attendance transactions, the
timestamp of creation, the hash of the previous block, a nonce value, and the final computed hash
of the block itself.
The hashing mechanism must be implemented using SHA-256, and the hash must be computed over
a combination of the block’s timestamp, transaction data, previous hash, and nonce. Any
modification to the block or its transactions must immediately invalidate the chain, demonstrating
the blockchain’s immutability principle.
You must also implement a simplified Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. When mining a block, your
system should repeatedly modify the nonce until the resulting hash starts with “0000”. This ensures
that each block requires computational effort to create, just like real blockchain mining.
Chain validation is required as well. Your system must implement a validation function that
recalculates the hash of every block, checks that each block’s previous hash correctly matches the
hash of the block before it, and verifies that all PoW conditions are satisfied. If even a single block is
tampered with, the validation function must clearly show that the chain is no longer valid.

A. Block Structure (Mandatory fields)
Field Description
index Block number
timestamp System time
transaction
s Attendance or metadata (student/class/department)
prev_hash Previous block hash (from parent chain or same

chain)
nonce PoW nonce
hash Final SHA-256 result
B. Three Interlinked Chains (Mandatory)
1. Department Chain
Independent chain.
2. Class Chain
Genesis block must use:
prev_hash = last_hash_of_its_department_chain
3. Student Chain
Genesis block must use:
prev_hash = last_hash_of_its_class_chain
Attendance Blocks
These attach sequentially to the student chain.
This creates a pyramid blockchain.
C. Hashing Requirements
Your SHA-256 hash must include:
 timestamp
 transaction payload
 previous hash
 nonce
No shortcuts.

E. Multi-Level Validation Logic
Your validation must check:
1. Department chain valid
2. Each class chain is valid
3. Each class chain begins with correct department hash
4. Each student chain is valid
5. Each student chain begins with correct class hash
6. Attendance records re-hash correctly
7. PoW valid for every block
If any chain is tampered with, all dependent chains must show as invalid.
